# Branch And Tag Protection

Committed files provide CI, release verification, CODEOWNERS, templates, and documentation. They do not protect the repository by themselves. A repository admin must configure GitHub rulesets and the trusted production runner model.

## Main Branch Ruleset

Target:

```text
refs/heads/main
```

Required settings:

- Require pull request before merging
- Require at least 1 approval
- Dismiss stale approvals
- Require required status checks
- Require branch to be up to date before merge
- Block force pushes
- Block branch deletion
- Restrict bypass permissions

Recommended required status checks:

- `validate`
- `action-security`

Team-maintained ideal:

- Require review from Code Owners.
- Require approval of the most recent push.

Solo-maintainer practical mode:

- Keep `.github/CODEOWNERS` as advisory documentation for operations/security ownership.
- For now, do not require both `Require review from Code Owners` and `Require approval of the most recent push`.
- Disable either `Require review from Code Owners` or `Require approval of the most recent push` so a one-person repository can still merge protected `.github/` and CI/CD changes.
- Treat this as a temporary operational tradeoff. Re-enable both controls after a second trusted maintainer or team exists.

## Release Tag Ruleset

Target:

```text
refs/tags/v*
```

Required settings:

- Protect `v*` tags
- Restrict tag creation
- Restrict tag updates
- Restrict tag deletion
- Block force pushes
- Block moving tags
- Allow tag creation only from trusted release maintainers or the release GitHub App

Manual local tag pushes should be blocked for normal developers. The preferred path is the `Create Release Tag` workflow, which creates annotated tags from the current `main` commit.

The `Create Release Tag` workflow uses a dedicated GitHub App installation token to push protected `v*` tags. Configure the tag ruleset bypass list so only that release App, or explicitly trusted release maintainers, can create protected release tags.

Set this repo or org variable:

```text
RELEASE_APP_ID
```

`RELEASE_APP_ID` must identify the release GitHub App.

Set this repository secret:

```text
RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Rotate the App private key if release ownership changes and do not reuse it for production runtime access.

## Production Environment

The lowered-control workflow model does not require a GitHub deployment environment for release publication or manual deployment. Repository administrators may delete the `production` environment after confirming it has no secrets or variables.

The `Deploy App` workflow still targets a trusted self-hosted runner labeled `production`. Keep production runtime secrets and the production env file on the target host or in the chosen repository/organization secret store for that trusted runner model, not in pull request workflows.

## Acceptance Checks

- Direct push to `main` is rejected.
- Pull requests cannot merge without required checks.
- Pull requests cannot merge without required approvals.
- Pull requests touching CODEOWNERS paths require CODEOWNER approval when Code Owners review is enabled.
- Force pushes and branch deletion for `main` are rejected.
- Untrusted users cannot create, move, or delete `v*` tags.
- Release tags outside `main` history fail in the release workflow.
- Release publication starts automatically after a protected `v*` tag is created and fails if tag source verification or build validation fails.
